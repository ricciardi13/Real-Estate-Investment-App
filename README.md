<h2>Summary<h2>
This application was created to fetch residential real estate rental information. Specifically, users provide basic information for a home search such as city, state, maximum price, etc., and is matched with up to three properties depending on the provided information. Each property is listed with it's current sale price, projected monthly rental income, and rate of return as a percentage. After viewing the properties, users can start the search process over again by clicking on the "New Search" button. <br><br>
The listing information for properties for sale is provided by Realtor.com and the projected rental income is provided from RealtyMole. Rate of return is simply calculated by dividing annual rental income by property sales price.
